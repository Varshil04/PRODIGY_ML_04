# Gesture Recognition Using Image Data

This Jupyter Notebook performs basic image processing and gesture recognition setup using a small dataset of grayscale gesture images. It involves loading and preprocessing gesture image data for further machine learning tasks such as classification.

# üì¶ Features

‚Ä¢ Image loading using OpenCV.

‚Ä¢ Image resizing and grayscale conversion.

‚Ä¢ Label assignment for gesture classification.

‚Ä¢ Basic data preparation for model training.

# üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Used

‚Ä¢ NumPy

‚Ä¢ Pandas

‚Ä¢ Matplotlib

‚Ä¢ OpenCV (cv2)

‚Ä¢ scikit-learn (for data splitting)
